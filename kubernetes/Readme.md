# Kubernetes

Once youâ€™ve submitted the manifest to the API server, the Kubernetes scheduler finds a machine where the Pod can fit and schedules the Pod to that machine. Once scheduled, the kubelet daemon on that machine is responsible for creating the containers that correspond to the Pod, as well as performing any health checks defined in the Pod manifest.

Once a Pod is scheduled to a node, no rescheduling occurs if that node fails. Additionally, to create multiple replicas of the same Pod you have to create and name them manually. In a Chapter Nine we introduce the ReplicaSet object and show how you can automate the creation of multiple identical Pods and ensure that they are recreated in the event of a node machine failure.
